# JavasScript - what can we do?
JavaScript is one of the 3 essential parts to learn with front end web coding.
- HTML gives us the structure of a webpage
- CSS gives us the ability to layout and style the webpage
- JavaScript allows us to define the behaviour and interactivity of the webpage.

## JavaScript - Adding to webpages
There are 2 ways to add JavaScript into a webpage.
### Method 1.
Use the [<script></script>] tag in your HTML file. 
Place your code between the opening and closing tags.
### Method 2.
Have your JavaScript in an external file with a .js extension.
Use the [<script></script>] tag with a src attribute to link your external file
to your HTML file. (similar to linking a CSS file).
The src can link to:
- a JS file using no path (just filename, i.e. src="app.js")
- a JS file using a path (i.e. src="./js/app.js")
- or a full url (i.e. src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js")
